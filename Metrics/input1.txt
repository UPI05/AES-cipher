The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. The IoT has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives, from how we manage our homes and cities to how we monitor our health and well-being.
